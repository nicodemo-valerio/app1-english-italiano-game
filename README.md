# English-Italian mobile app game
My first mobile app developed using React Native + Expo.<br>
This is a simple game that helps to learn English and Italian languages. You have to drag pictures of objects onto the correct word.<br>
You can play using the Expo app https://expo.io/@ncdm.developer/english-vs-italiano-game
